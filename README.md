# Feature-Ranking-Self-Growing-Forest
A tree ensemble algorithm that automatically grows decision based until a the trees' structure diversity is optimized for performance and low computational cost. Can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Functions and a script example are programmed in MATLAB. A class is implemented for Python. }
For using the code with MATLAB the files "FSF.mat", FSF_tree, FSF_rand_split and FSF_prediction need to be downloaded and placed in the same folder where the intended script will be run. If there are any doubts of how to use FSF, an example of how to use FSF for classification and regression is provided in the script "FSF_Example_classification_and_regression.mat". The script must be placed in the same folder as the other MATLAB functions of FSF. 
An implementation in Python of FSF is also available, as also is an example for classification and regression. To run the example of FSF in Python, the FSF.py must be downloaded, as well as, the exmple for classification "DemoforClassification.py" and the example for regression "DemoForRegression.py". FSF is a class that can be used to create the ensemble and perform predictions with it.
